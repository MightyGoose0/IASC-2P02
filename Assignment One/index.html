        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>  Once upon a time, there was a land of two-dimensional figures trapped inside a cave. A frightening figure’s shadow eerily looms over the interior of the cave. This causes the figures to think that this satanic figure curses their world. The cave dwellers believe the devil from outside the cave keeps them down and constrained to the cave. The figures living in the cave imagine the world outside as vast and full of opportunities; however, they will never get to experience it because of their fear of the demonic god that traps them. With this in mind, the figures can only dream of being freed from their cursed reign to experience life outside the cave. If they can get past this devil god, they will be free and experience the fruits of life.  However, due to the flatlander's mindset of being contrasted to the looming figure, they will never seek refuge outside the cave and forever live entrapped by fear and worry.

        <p>Flatness is a blanket term that Nick Sousanis's uses to describe 1-dimensional, unoriginal and traditional. Nick articulates his thought of people being constrained due to how society has raised them and tries to break that notion. The concept of flatness means to me that if you use traditional
            thought or advice, you will receive traditional results. No one should expect to get unconventional results if you're following a traditional regime. <span class="clickable" id="first-change"> One day </span> the demonic 
            figure started to leave but would periodically appear again. Which made the flatlanders hypothesize that the devil had other caves to look after and only
             had a period of time stationed to look after theirs. This got the hopes up of the flatlanders that if they timed their escape perfectly, they would be able to escape and experience life outside the cave. The flatlanders began an operation
              to formulate the schedule and came to the conclusion the devil held a strict schedule, leaving them unattended for 15 ticks and attending for only five ticks (they measure in ticks due to their limited concept
               of time, as they never see the sun). <span class="clickable" id="second-change">Suddenly, </span> the devil appeared back to his post but this time he wasn't stagnant. He was moving wildly and fast. The Flatlanders have never seen anything like this; they couldn't understand why he was moving like this. When the devil moves to the middle, he becomes smaller, and his horns disappear; then, he gains them again when he reaches the edges of the cave. The Flatlanders were perplexed. Was he casting a spell? What's going on with his horns? Is he shedding them? None of them could piece it together. But none of the flatlanders ever decided to challenge the devil, none of them took a step outside while he was gone, and no one attacked the devil when he had no horns. For all the flatlanders know, the devil can’t even fight back, and you pass right through him. However, because of the school of thought from the flatlanders that a scary symbol means you should feel fear and not oppose, the flatlanders never found any answers.</p>
