        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>Once upon a time, there was a land of two-dimensional figures trapped inside a cave. A frightening figure’s shadow eerily looms over the interior of the cave. This causes the figures to think that this satanic figure curses their world. The cave dwellers believe the devil from outside the cave keeps them down and constrained to the cave. The figures living in the cave imagine the world outside as vast and full of opportunities; however, they will never get to experience it because of their fear of the demonic god that traps them. With this in mind, the figures can only dream of being freed from their cursed reign to experience life outside the cave. If they can get past this devil god, they will be free and experience the fruits of life.  However, due to the flatlander's mindset of being contrasted to the looming figure, they will never seek refuge outside the cave and forever live entrapped by fear and worry.  the object began to move strangely.</p>

        <p>Flatness is a blanket term that Nick Sousanis's uses to describe 1-dimensional, unoriginal and traditional. Nick articulates his thought of people being constrained due to how society has raised them and tries to break that notion. The concept of flatness means to me that if you use traditional thought or advice, you will receive traditional results. No one should expect to get unconventional results if you're following a traditional regime.<span class="clickable" id="first-change"> One day </span> the demonic figure started to leave but would periodically appear again. Which made the flatlanders hypothesize that the devil had other caves to look after and only had a period of time stationed to look after theirs. This got the hopes up of the flatlanders that if they timed their escape perfectly, they would be able to escape and experience life outside the cave. The flatlanders began an operation to formulate the schedule and came to the conclusion the devil held a strict schedule, leaving them unattended for 15 ticks and attending for only five ticks (they measure in ticks due to their limited concept of time, as they never see the sun). 
            <span class="clickable" id="second-change"> Suddenly, </span> the devil appeared back to his post but this time he wasn't stagnant. He was moving wildly and fast. The Flatlanders have never seen anything like this; they couldn't understand why he was moving like this. When the devil moves to the middle, he becomes smaller, and his horns disappear; then, he gains them again when he reaches the edges of the cave. The Flatlanders were perplexed. Was he casting a spell? What's going on with his horns? Is he shedding them? None of them could piece it together. But none of the flatlanders ever decided to challenge the devil, none of them took a step outside while he was gone, and no one attacked the devil when he had no horns. For all the flatlanders know, the devil can’t even fight back, and you pass right through him. However, because of the school of thought from the flatlanders that a scary symbol means you should feel fear and not oppose, the flatlanders never found any answers.

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>

        <p>Now that we have the 3D perspective on the world of the flatlanders, we can see there is no devil. In fact, it’s just a friendly circle that had been impaled by two tetrahedrons. When the flatlanders thought this circle was only keeping an eye on them for a period of time, it was just going 360 degrees around the flatlander's world, keeping an eye on them from all angles. The 3D people viewed this as the circle playing ring around the rosie around a cave. As for when the circle loses his horns this is just happening when it passes through the sun of our scene, and the camera doesn't pick them up anymore. The sun in the scene stays stationary for the entire time, acting as a fixed variable in this demonstration. 
           </p>

        <p>Nick Sousanis's definition of the term “seeing double” is that when you look at a situation from separate angles and unpack each layer of the problem one at a time with different perspectives in mind, is how you get the correct solution. To me, seeing double means developing the skill of empathy to the highest degree. Empathy encapsulates seeing double as you try to put yourself in other people's shoes. By putting yourself in other shoes, you create alternate perspectives of the scenario and look at the entire picture rather than just a shadow. The people in 2D never get to experience the big picture of what is happening around them, while the 3D people never experience the small picture of what is happening inside them. This creates a paradox of no one being able to see the complete picture; however, they both have their own thoughts of what the complete picture is. So, how do you view the whole picture? We finally get to understand the picture only by combining both perspectives. We become enlightened on how the 2D people lived in fear of the circle while the 3D people thought he was just moving around in circles. <span class="clickable" id="third-change">(Conclusion) </span> Now, the circle has moved into a spot where the cave dwellers will never see him, and they can live in peace without fear of a cursed devil haunting their lives. But in reality, he just moved up and will continue to make the same movements, but now he just has a new perspective on them.  <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change"> </span></p>
